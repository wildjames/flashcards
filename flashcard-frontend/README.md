This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# TODO list

## Bulk imports

I wanted control over bulk importing. There are a few core ones that I want:

- [x] CSV (arbitrary delimiter, including tabs)
- [x] JSON
- [ ] Confluence copy-paste (newline-delimited, user-defined number of columns)
- [ ] Google sheets live-update
- [ ] Web-scraping. Maybe via webhooks?
- [STRETCH GOAL?] Database hookup?

The google sheets group creation dialogue box is in there, I just need a backend endpoint to handle it. Probably some background task to run an update every 15 minutes? Hour? Whatever. I could use APScheduler. A new task for each sheet, or one master update task that spawns them all at once?

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
